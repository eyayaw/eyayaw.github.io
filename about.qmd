Hi there, this is Eyayaw Beze (እያያው ተካ).

<span class="pronunciation">Help pronounce my name? Think of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm4R8d0d8kU">Old McDonald song</a> --- "E-I-E-I-O".</span>

## About Me {.bio-section}

::: bio-text
I grew up in a small village called Shumshuha (ሹምሹሃ) (aka Lalibela
Airport) about 10km southwest of the historic town [Lalibela,
Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalibela).

I went to Bahir Dar University for my undergrad, for my master's to [KDI
School]({{< var kdis-url >}}) in South Korea, and to Budapest,
Regensburg and Trento for a joint European master in comparative local
development ([Master
CoDe](https://www.unitn.it/ateneo/813/joint-european-master-of-local-development-code)).

For more than three years, I worked for Jimma University, [department of
Economics](https://ju.edu.et/college-of-business-and-conomics/), where I
taught undergrad economics courses.

I did my Ph.D. in Urban Economics at [RGS
Econ](https://www.rgs-econ.org/), based at the [University of
Duisburg-Essen]({{< var ude-url >}}).

If you come to the [Ruhrgebiet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr) (or generally NRW) or to [Randstad, the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randstad), drop me a message through one of the [socials](index.qmd#quick-links). I would be happy to grab a coffee or a beer (Pils oder Blonde?).

I love data generation, through web scraping, api hacking, etc. If you want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out.
